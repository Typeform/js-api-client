## Installation

``` bash
# install with yarn
yarn add @typeform/api-client

# install with npm
npm install @typeform/api-client --save
```

## Usage

### Initialize

1. Import client library

``` javascript
  // If using ESM syntax
  import { createClient } from '@typeform/api-client'
  // If using CJS syntax
  const { createClient } = require('@typeform/api-client')
```

2. Create an instance with your personal token

``` javascript
  const typeformAPI = createClient({ token: '<your token>' })
```

3. Use any of the methods available in the [reference](#reference)

``` javascript
  // will retrieve all forms
  typeformAPI
    .forms
    .list()
    .then(response => {
      // do what do you want with your typeforms
    })
```

## Reference

### `createClient({token})`

- Creates a new instance of Typeform's JS client
- Returns an instance with the methods described below

``` javascript
  const typeformClient = createClient({ token: '<your token>' })

  // If what you are trying to acces doesn't require a token, you can construct the client without any argument
  const typeformAPI = createClient()
```

Client returns the following properties:

- `forms`
- `images`
- `teams`
- `workspaces`
- `themes`
- `responses`
- `webhooks`

Each one of them encapsulates the operations related to it (like listing, updating, deleting the resource).

## Examples

### Update specific typeform property, as [referenced here](https://developer.typeform.com/create/reference/update-form-patch/)

``` javascript
  typeformClient
    .forms
    .update({
      uid: 'asdf',
      data: [
        {
          "op": "replace",
          "path": "/title",
          "value": 'new title'
        }
      ]
    })
    .then(response => {
      //...
    })
```

### Update the whole typeform

``` javascript
  typeformClient
    .forms
    .update({
      uid: 'asdf',
      override: true,
      data: {
        "title": newTitle,
        "theme": {
          "href": "https://api.typeform.com/themes/6lPNE6"
        }
      }
    })
    .then(response => {
      //...
    })
```

**Note:**
The theme property applies a `theme` to the form. If you don't specify a value for the 'theme' property, Typeform applies a new copy of the default theme to the form, **even if you already have a copy of the default theme applied to this form**. 

### Uploading an image

``` javascript
  typeformClient
    .images
    .add({
      image: "bGRqZmxzZGpmbHNoZmtoc2RrZmpoc2tqZA==",
      mediaType: "image/gif",
      fileName: "newimage.gif"
    })
    .then(response => {
      //...
    })

```

### Getting the thumbnail of an image

``` javascript
  typeformClient
    .images
    .get({ id: 'asdf', size: 'thumbnail' })
    .then(response => {
      //...
    })

```
